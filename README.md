This folder contains a few projects I completed for my Data Structures class
(DSA_5005) at the University of Oklahoma. Projects were completed in C++.

Project 1: Making a class that would store a sparse matrix in compressed
    sparse row (CSR) form.

Project 2: Make a tree class. Perform various traversals (i.e., preorder,
    inorder, postorder) and finding various attributes about the tree.

Project 3: Implementing a graph using an adjacency matrix. The adjacency matrix
    was constructed using the CSR spare matrix from project 1. Various graph
    travels (BFD, DFS) were coded as routines as well.
